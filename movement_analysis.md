## Defensive Movement Analysis

### Individual Defender Dynamics
We observe that defender movements follow a modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:

$$ dv = -\gamma(v - v_p)dt + \sigma dW_t $$

Where:
- $v_p$ is preferred velocity
- $\gamma$ is response rate
- $W_t$ is a Wiener process

This mathematical framework reveals how defenders balance between:
1. Maintaining assigned coverage responsibilities
2. Responding to offensive movements
3. Coordinating with teammates

The animation above demonstrates these principles in action, showing how theoretical
predictions align with actual defensive movements.
