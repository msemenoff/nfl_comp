# Ecological Movement Modeling in NFL Defense: A Mathematical Analysis
        
## Introduction
This analysis explores defensive movement patterns in the NFL through the lens of ecological 
movement modeling, focusing on the SF's defensive unit. By applying principles from 
ecological mathematics and movement theory, we uncover the underlying patterns that govern 
effective defensive coverage.

The movement of defensive players can be understood as a complex dynamical system, where 
individual agents (defenders) respond to both local and global stimuli while maintaining 
coordinated coverage of spatial zones.
