## Coverage Zone Analysis

### Optimal Coverage Theory
The defensive unit seeks to minimize the coverage gap function:

$$ G(\mathbf{X}) = \max_{y \in \Omega} \min_{i} \|y - x_i\| $$

This optimization problem leads to emergent behavior that we observe in the tracking data:

The heat map above shows the realized coverage density compared to theoretical optimal
distribution.
