## Results and Interpretation

Our mathematical analysis reveals several key insights:

1. **Optimality Conditions**
   The observed defensive movements satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation:
   $$ \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 0 $$
   where $L$ is the Lagrangian of the system.

2. **Pattern Emergence**
   Defensive coordination emerges from local rules following:
   $$ \dot{x}_i = \sum_{j \neq i} f(\|x_j - x_i\|)(x_j - x_i) $$

3. **Efficiency Boundaries**
   Performance limits are governed by:
   $$ \eta_{max} = \sup_{\mathbf{X}} \{\eta(\mathbf{X}) : C(\mathbf{X}) \geq c_{min}\} $$
