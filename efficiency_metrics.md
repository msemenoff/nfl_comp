## Efficiency and Performance Metrics

### Quantitative Performance Measures
Movement efficiency is evaluated through multiple metrics:

1. **Path Efficiency Ratio**:
   $$ \eta_{path} = \frac{d_{optimal}}{d_{actual}} $$

2. **Coverage Quality Index**:
   $$ Q_c = \int_\Omega \phi(x)dx $$

3. **Coordination Coefficient**:
   $$ C = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \psi(t)dt $$
