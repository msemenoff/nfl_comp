## Conclusions and Future Directions

Our mathematical analysis demonstrates that NFL defensive movements follow predictable
patterns governed by fundamental principles of collective motion and optimal control theory.
Key findings include:

1. Emergence of optimal coverage patterns through local interactions
2. Quantifiable trade-offs between individual and collective efficiency
3. Predictable response patterns based on environmental constraints

Future work will explore:
- Higher-order movement correlations
- Non-linear response functions
- Stochastic game theory applications
