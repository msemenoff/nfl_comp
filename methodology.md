## Methodology: From Theory to Practice

### Implementation of Mathematical Models
Our analysis translates these mathematical principles into practical metrics:

1. **Movement Pattern Analysis**
   - Discretized version of continuous movement equations
   - Numerical integration of path efficiencies
   - Statistical analysis of coverage patterns

2. **Spatial Analysis Framework**
   - Voronoi tessellation of defensive coverage
   - Dynamic time warping for pattern matching
   - Kernel density estimation for zone coverage

3. **Efficiency Calculations**
   - Path integral computation
   - Coverage optimization algorithms
   - Coordination metric evaluation

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. Position tracking at 10 Hz
2. Velocity and acceleration computation
3. Coverage zone calculation
4. Pattern recognition and classification
