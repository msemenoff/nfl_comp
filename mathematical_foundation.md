## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Movement Dynamics
Individual defender movement can be modeled using a stochastic differential equation:

$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = v(t) + \sigma(x,t)\xi(t) $$

Where:
- $x(t)$ represents position vector
- $v(t)$ is the velocity field
- $\sigma(x,t)$ captures environmental influence
- $\xi(t)$ represents random fluctuations

### 2. Coverage Zone Optimization
The optimal coverage configuration minimizes the exposure function:

$$ E(\mathbf{X}) = \int_\Omega \min_{i} \|x - x_i\| dx $$

Where:
- $\mathbf{X} = (x_1,...,x_n)$ represents defender positions
- $\Omega$ is the field area
- $\|x - x_i\|$ is the distance to defender $i$

### 3. Collective Motion Metrics
Team coordination is quantified through the order parameter:

$$ \psi(t) = \frac{1}{N}\left|\sum_{i=1}^N e^{i\theta_i(t)}\right| $$

Where:
- $N$ is the number of defenders
- $\theta_i(t)$ is the movement direction of defender $i$

### 4. Path Efficiency Analysis
Movement efficiency is calculated using the ratio:

$$ \eta = \frac{\|x_f - x_0\|}{\int_0^T \|v(t)\| dt} $$

Where:
- $x_0$ and $x_f$ are initial and final positions
- $T$ is the play duration
- $\|v(t)\|$ is instantaneous speed

### 5. Zone Coverage Model
Coverage quality is evaluated using a potential field approach:

$$ \phi(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i e^{-\|x-x_i\|^2/2\sigma_i^2} $$

Where:
- $A_i$ is defender effectiveness
- $\sigma_i$ is coverage radius
